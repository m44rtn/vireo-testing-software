# This file tells the setup program which files should be copied where.
#
# The format is as follows:
# [path to file] [where to copy]
#
# places to copy:
# s[number] - sector to copy to (LBA number)
# [path]    - path to copy to (non-existing dirs will be created 
#             automatically)
#
# A path starting with '/' means that the file listed is read from/written to
# the already selected disk (the slash signifies the root of that disk). For 
# the [path to file] this is the bootdisk.
# For the [where to copy] this is the disk currently hardcoded into
# the program (currently HD0P0).
# This is also the case for sectors (s[number]), another disk cannot be specified for sectors.
